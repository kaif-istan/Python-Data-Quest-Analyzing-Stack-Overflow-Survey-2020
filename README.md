Introduction
Stack Overflow’s annual Developer Survey is the largest and most comprehensive survey of people who code around the world. Each year, we field a survey covering everything from developers’ favorite technologies to their job preferences.Year 2020 marks the ninth year that stackoverFlow published their annual Developer Survey results, and nearly 90,000 developers took the 20-minute  survey.


Under this project, we'll analyze the StackOverflow developer survey dataset. The dataset contains responses to an annual survey conducted by StackOverflow. We can find the raw data & official analysis easily here: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey.
